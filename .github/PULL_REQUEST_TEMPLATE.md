**_It is the reviewers responsibility to also make sure every item here has been covered_**

-   [ ] **Function & Class comments**: All function definitions should have comments, which are checked by the linters (ie. `pylint`).
-   [ ] **Remove all commented out code**
-   [ ] **Remove extra print statements**: for example, those just used for testing
-   [ ] **Resolve all TODO's**: All `TODO` (or similar) statements should either be completed or associated with a github issue

<!--
    Feel free to make additions of things that we should be checking to this file if you think there's something missing!!!!
    At the same time, consider that adding things to this list increases the burden on everyone opening a pull request.
    Perhaps there is a way we can automatically enforce whatever item you want to add?
